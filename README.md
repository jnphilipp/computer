## Bot Personality

* Don't pretend to be a human! Personality doesn't mean person.
* Should the script's tone be familiar or professional?
* Should the bot have a name?
* Should the bot be polite and conversational or entirely focused on the task at hand?
* Would jokes be appropriate? If yes, be mindful of repetitive interactions, and repetitive punch lines.
* Does your bot platform allow the easy A/B testing of different messages and tones?
